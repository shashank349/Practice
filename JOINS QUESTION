. INNER JOIN:
Question 1:
List the names of students and their corresponding department names for students who are enrolled in a department.
Hint: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the Student and Department tables, ensuring that only students with valid department IDs are included.

Question 2:
Find all the students who are enrolled in the "Mechanical Engineering" department and list their names, roll numbers, and department names.
Hint: Use an INNER JOIN between Student and Department and filter using the department name.

2. LEFT JOIN:
Question 1:
List all the students along with their department names. Even if a student is not assigned to any department, they should still be shown in the result.
Hint: Use a LEFT JOIN between the Student and Department tables, ensuring students without a department are also included.

Question 2:
Get a list of all departments along with the names of students in those departments. Show all departments, even those with no students.
Hint: Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the Department and Student tables.

3. RIGHT JOIN:
Question 1:
List all the departments and their students. If there are departments with no students, still show those departments in the result.
Hint: Use a RIGHT JOIN between Department and Student to include all departments, even those without students.

Question 2:
Find all students along with the names of their respective departments. Show all students, including those who might not have a valid department (if any).
Hint: Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that all students are included, even those with no department.

4. FULL JOIN:
Question 1:
List all students along with their department names, including students who are not assigned to any department and departments that have no students.
Hint: Use a FULL JOIN between Student and Department to include all students and all departments, even if they don't have corresponding records in the other table.

Question 2:
Get a list of all departments and students, ensuring that departments with no students and students without a department are also shown.
Hint: Use a FULL JOIN to combine the tables and include unmatched records.

5. CROSS JOIN:
Question 1:
Create a list of all possible combinations of students and departments. This should include every student paired with every department.
Hint: Use a CROSS JOIN to generate the Cartesian product of the Student and Department tables.

Question 2:
List all pairs of students and departments, including combinations where the same student appears with multiple departments and vice versa.
Hint: Use a CROSS JOIN to generate every possible pairing of students and departments.

6. SELF JOIN:
Question 1:
Find all students who share the same department. List their names and department names, but avoid duplicates.
Hint: Use a SELF JOIN on the Student table by joining on the did (department ID) and ensuring different students are displayed.

Question 2:
List all pairs of students who have the same department and have a roll number greater than the other.
Hint: Use a SELF JOIN to compare two different students in the same department, filtering based on roll number.
